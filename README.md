# Mobile Development Setup

## Objective

Set up and test the mobile development environment using Expo Go to prepare for upcoming projects.

## Tools Installed

- Node.js LTS (vXX.X.X)
- npm (vX.X.X)
- VS Code
- Operating System: [macOS/Linux/Windows]

## Expo Go Setup

1. Installed Expo Go from [https://expo.dev/go](https://expo.dev/go).
2. Created an Expo account and logged in successfully.
3. Ran a test project with:
   ```bash
   npx create-expo-app TestApp
   cd TestApp
   npx expo start
   ```

```

4. Scanned the QR code with Expo Go on my device.
5. Successfully launched the test app on my phone.

## Challenges Faced

* \Had to update Node.js to LTS before installing Expo Go.
* \QR code scanning didnâ€™t work until I connected both laptop and phone to the same Wi-Fi.

## Next Steps

* Use this environment for future mobile app projects.
* Explore Expo SDK features for faster development.
